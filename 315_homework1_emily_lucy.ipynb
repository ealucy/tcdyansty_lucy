    "Variables are necessary in computer coding because we need symbols to take the place of ideas. They are also used to simplify problems, in order to repeat them again and again if need be. The variable is a tool to save information and use it again. It is important to be aware that Python distinguishes between types of data (such as int, float, and string) beacause it can easily become confusing if one does not know this. For example, the string \"123\" does not have the value of the integer one hundred and twenty three. It is simply three numbers strung together. It is also important to understand float, because in different operations such as addition and subtraction, if at least one of the numbers is float, the answer must be float. "
